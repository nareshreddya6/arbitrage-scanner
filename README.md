CEX/DEX Arbitrage Scanner

Overview:
This project is designed to identify arbitrage opportunities between centralized exchange (CEX) Binance and decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Solana blockchain. It scans token pairs traded against USDC, calculates real-time price differences, and determines profitability after accounting for trading fees, network costs, and slippage.

Features:
Fetches real-time price data from:
Binance (CEX API)
Solana DEX (e.g., coingecko/Serum/Raydium) via RPC
Calculates arbitrage profitability considering:
Binance trading fees (0.1% maker/taker)
Solana DEX swap fees (0.3%)
Solana transaction costs
Potential slippage and execution risks
Displays actionable arbitrage opportunities.

Installations:
python-binance
requests
pytest
Flask==2.2.2
